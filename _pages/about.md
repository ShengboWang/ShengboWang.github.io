I am a PhD student with the [COLA Laboratory](https://colalab.ai), College of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), and also a visiting scholar with the [Intelligent Computing and Systems Lab](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/centre-artificial-intelligence/aaii-research/aaii-research-labs/intelligent-computing-and-systems), AAII, University of Technology Sydney. My research interests include the control theory, optimization theory, and stochastic processes. The major topic of my research is safe control and optimization. More specifically, I am investigating the safe control frameworks for autonomous systems, including safe control design, safe/constrained optimization and the applications in robotics and healthcare. Currently, I am studying the control barrier function method, meta-learning, and Bayesian optimization. Some preliminary works can be found in my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4Kdt5eQAAAAJ&hl=en).


# About this website
In addition to some introductions of my previous work, I will maintain a record to my daily study including notes of courses and lists of reading papers. Moreover, some chit-chat, which is more important to myself of my interested fields such like books, gaming and diaries, will be posted. Perhaps this is the key motivation for this personal website. By the way, I insist on using Chinese to some content in consideration of the expressiveness.


Finally, it is nice to meet you, my dear friend.
